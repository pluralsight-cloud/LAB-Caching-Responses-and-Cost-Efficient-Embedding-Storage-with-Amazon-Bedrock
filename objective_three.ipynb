You’ll create embeddings from a set of meal recipes and explore different storage and search strategies, including in-memory storage, FAISS for vector indexing, Amazon S3 for persistent object storage, and PostgreSQL with the pgvector extension for SQL-based similarity search. Each approach demonstrates how to store and retrieve embeddings efficiently, along with its performance characteristics and associated storage costs."

It then performs a similarity search by embedding a user query and retrieving the top relevant recipe, ordered by distance from the query embedding."
